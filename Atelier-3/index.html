                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>
                        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. i<br>

                    <p>I was an ENT for many years before joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>
                        the tree intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12<br>
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've<br>
                        successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    <p> Before joining the bootcamp, l've<br>
                        never written a line of code. I needed<br>
                        some structure from professionals<br>
                        who can help me learn programming<br>
                        step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
                        enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
                        who can only say wonderful things<br>
                        about the program. The entire<br>
                        curriculum and staff did not<br>
                        disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
                        and I never had to wait long tor<br>
                        assistance. The agile team project, in<br>
                        particular, was outstanding. It took<br>
                        my learning to the next level ina way<br>
                        that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>
                        fact. I've often referred to it during<br>
                        interviews as an example of my<br>
                        developent experience. It certainly<br>
                        helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>
                        developer after receiving multiple<br>
                        offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
